# 2234. Maximum Total Beauty of the Gardens
# We will sort the gardens to have the small values in front and big values in the end.
# We will first remove as many full gardens as possible.
# We will then spend all the remaining newFlowers to increase the minimum
# We will then return the removed gardens one by one and repeat the previous step to find the max beauty at each step.
